# Kolmogorov-Arnold-Networks-Framework
This is a Python implementation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Networks Framework. The framework is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem, which states that any continuous function can be represented as a composition of a finite number of elementary functions.
